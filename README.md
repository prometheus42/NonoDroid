# NonoDroid - A free implementation of the nonogram game for Android

## Description

NonoDroid is an open-source implementation of the nonogram game — a logic puzzle
in which cells in a grid have to be colored or left blank according to numbers
given at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture — for Android devices. 

## License

Many of the distributed nonograms are of our own design. But some were
collected from different sources on the internet and out of magazines. If your
nonogram found its way into NonoDroid and you do not want that, please inform
us and we will remove it from our distribution.

NonoDroid requires at least Android 6.
